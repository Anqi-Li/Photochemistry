 IGNORE FIRST FOLDER CALLED ".ipynb_checkpoints"

 Folder "files", the only important thing there is the absoption cross sections

 Folder "results". 
 It will be filled with .txt files once you run "Model2 x1 (original).ipynb"
 The data there, is the result of the first integration with the calculation
 of the photolysis rates with constant concentrations of all compounds

 Folder "results_2".
 Same as "results" but for the second integration with the 
 photolysis rates being calculated with the daily concentrations of the important compounds

 Folder "Model2 x1 (original).ipynb".
 First jupyter notebook, it calculates the data for the folders "results" & "results_2". 
 It takes a few hours (3h for me) to do all the integration.

 Folder "Model ANALYSIS.ipynb".
 Second jupyter notebook, it gives a graphical representation for the folders "results" & "results_2". 
 Also is where I was doing all the analysis for the satellite data you where giving me.
